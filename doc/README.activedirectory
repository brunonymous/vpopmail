The origin and status of the ActiveDirectory module is unknown

It is believed this module was written to allow a once-off migration
of accounts from an ActiveDirectory server over to another vpopmail
authentication system

This module has been removed.  The CDB and MySQL modules are the two 
that are recommended for production environments.
