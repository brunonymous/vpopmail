<P>
You are now ready to add virtual domains and virtual users. See
vadddomain and vadduser. You also need to modify your pop server
startup line to use the vchkpw program for authentication.</P>
<H3>Setting up all email to be virtual</H3>
<P>We recommend that all domains be setup as virtualdomains. 
</P>
<H3>Configuration options</H3>
<H4>Most used options</H4>
<H5>--enable-roaming-users=n|y Enable or disable open relay after pop
authentication. Default is no</H5>
<DL>
	<DD>Setting this to yes means that the clients IP address is added
	to the list of IP's that are allowed to relay through the smtp
	server after they authenticate with pop. A cronjob program,
	clearopensmtp, clears out any IP's that were authenticated over 3
	hours ago. This option requires you run the smtp server with
	tcpserver and the -x /etc/tcp.smtp.cdb option (or where ever you put
	your tcp.smtp.cdb file).</DD></DL>
<H5>
--enable-hardquota=#|n Set and Enable hard quota or n for no quota</H5>
<DL>
	<DD>Set's the default hard quota limit for each pop account. The
	default is 50 megs. Any incoming mail which would take the user over
	their hard quota limit is bounced with a message. This message can
	be customized. 
	</DD><DD>
	If you wish to turn off quotas set this option to NOQUOTA, i.e.
	--enable-hardquota=NOQUOTA</DD></DL>
<H5>
--enable-default-domain=name Default domain name, default is null.</H5>
<DL>
	<DD>We recommend you run all your email as virtual domains. You can
	pick one domain to be the default. If you have just one domain set
	it with this option. The default domain name users can authenticate
	with just their user name, and don't need to use
	&lt;user&gt;%&lt;virtualdomain&gt;. 
	</DD></DL>
<H5>
--enable-ip-alias-domains=y|n enable virutal domain lookup via
reverse ip address lookup for virtual domains. 
</H5>
<DL>
	<DD>By default, ever domain uses name based virtual domains. That
	is: users must supply their domain name in their pop name. i.e.
	&lt;user&gt;%&lt;virtualdomain&gt;. This can be overridden for one
	domain using the --enable-default-domain option.</DD><DD>
	<BR>
	</DD><DD>
	Vpopmail also supports IP based virtual domains. If this option is
	turned on, and the user does not supply %&lt;virtualdomain&gt; then
	a reverse IP lookup is done on the server IP address that the client
	connected to. If the servers IP address resolves to a domain name,
	then vpopmail uses that name as the domain. For example:</DD><DD>
	<BR>
	</DD><DD>
	IP w.x.y.z resolves to test.com. User sets their pop server ip to
	w.x.y.z and connects. Vpopmail gets the connection, checks the IP of
	the SERVER side of the connection. Does a reverse IP lookup and
	obtains test.com. User sends joe as their pop user name. Vpopmail
	uses test.com as the domain. 
	</DD><DD>
	<BR>
	</DD><DD>
	You can mix and match name and ip based virtual domains.</DD></DL>
<H5>
--enable-relay-clear-minutes=360 expire time for roaming users after
pop authentication.</H5>
<DL>
	<DD>If --enable-roamin-users=y  is set then this option sets how
	long clearopensmtp should keep IP's in the list. The default is 3
	hours.</DD></DL>
<H4>
Mysql options</H4>
<H4>--enable-mysql=n|y use mysql, default is no</H4>
<DL>
	<DD>Enable using mysql authentication. 
	</DD><DD>
	<BR>
	</DD><DD>
	NOTE: be sure to edit vmysql.h and set the mysql server name/ip,
	mysql user and mysql users password. This user must have the ability
	to create a database vpopmail and create tables within that
	database.</DD></DL>
<H4>
--enable-sqlincdir= Directory where sql include files are.</H4>
<DL>
	<DD>Set the directory where the mysql include files are. By default
	it is set to /usr/local/mysql. 
	</DD></DL>
<H4>
--enable-sqllibdir=/usr/lib/mysql Directory where sql libs are.</H4>
<DL>
	<DD>Set the directory where the mysql libmysqlclient.a file is. By
	default it looks in /usr/lib/mysql</DD></DL>
<H4>
--enable-sqllibs=mysqlclient libraries for sql linking.</H4>
<DL>
	<DD>Set the library to link in. By default this is libmysqlclient.a.
		</DD></DL>
<H4>
--enable-large-site=n|y Default is no, tune for large numbers of
users per domain</H4>
<DL>
	<DD>By default vpopmail puts all domain information in one table -
	vpopmail. This is the most efficent method for sites most sites. If
	you are running one site with a very large number of users, you may
	want to set this option to be yes. If set to yes, vpopmail will
	create a table for each virtual domain. The main difference is that
	the domain name is not stored in the database since the table
	contains the domains name. For sites with 500,000+ users it can save
	significant disk space. However, for sites with large numbers of
	virtual domains it can decrease mysql system performance.</DD></DL>
<H4>
Vpasswd/cdb options</H4>
<H5>--enable-ucspi-dir=dir Directory where the compiled ucspi package
is.</H5>
<DL>
	<DD>Set the directory where the ucspi-tcp package is located. By
	default this is set to ../ucspi-tcp-0.84. Vpopmail uses headers in
	this directory and uses two .a files.</DD></DL>
<H4>
Logging options</H4>
<H5>--enable-logging=e|y|n Turn on (y) or off (n) logging to syslog
or (e) only log errors 
</H5>
<DL>
	<DD>Set the level of logging. By default it only logs pop
	authentication errors. You can turn off all logging by setting it to
	no. And you can log all pop authentications by setting it to yes.</DD></DL>
<H5>
--enable-log-name=vpopmail set syslog name.</H5>
<DL>
	<DD>Over ride the default vpopmail syslog name.</DD></DL>
<H4>
User/group options</H4>
<H5>--enable-vpopuser=vpopmail user vchkpw was installed as.</H5>
<DL>
	<DD>If for some reason you want to install this package under a
	different user name, use this option.</DD></DL>
<H5>
--enable-vpopgroup=vchkpw group vchkpw was installed as.</H5>
<DL>
	<DD>If for some reason you want to install this package under a
	different group name, use this option.</DD></DL>
<H5>
--enable-admin-email=email-address e-mail of system administrator.</H5>
<DL>
	<DD>Override the default email administrator address.</DD></DL>
<H4>
Directory and file location options</H4>
<H5>--enable-tcpserver-file=/etc/tcp.smtp File where tcpserver -x
relay information is stored.</H5>
<DL>
	<DD>Set the file name of your tcp.smtp file. By default the
	configure program looks in /etc and then in /etc/tcprules.d
	directories.</DD></DL>
<H5>
--enable-qmaildir=dir directory where qmail is installed.</H5>
<DL>
	<DD>If you installed qmail into a directory other than /var/qmail,
	use this option.</DD></DL>
<H5>
--enable-tcprules-prog=/usr/local/bin/tcprules where is your tcprules
program.</H5>
<DL>
	<DD>If you installed the tcprules program into a directory other
	than /usr/local/bin, use this option.</DD></DL>
<H5>
--enable-apop-file=/etc/apop-secrets directory where apop secrerts
are stored.</H5>
<DL>
	<DD>Over ride the default location of the apop-secrets file.</DD></DL>
<H4>
Other options</H4>
<H5>--enable-apop=y|n Enable or disable apop authentication. 
</H5>
<DL>
	<DD>Disable apop by setting this option to no. The default is yes
	(pop and apop).</DD></DL>
<H5>
--enable-passwd=y|n Enable or disable /etc/passwd (or shadow)
authentication. 
</H5>
<DL>
	<DD>Over ride the automatic configuration. By default the
	configuration program will automatically detect if you are using
	passwd and shadow passwords. By setting this option to no, you will
	disable all /etc/passwd authentication.</DD></DL>
<H3>
Qmail and Virtual domains</H3>
<P>Qmail has an idea of email domains that are &quot;local&quot; and
&quot;virtual&quot;. Local domains are ones which primarily match
against /etc/passwd. Virtual domains match against domains listed in
the qmail control file &quot;virtualdomains&quot;. Vpopmail makes use
of the qmail users/assign file and virtualdomains file. The
users/assign file gets compiled into a users/cdb file. It is a hashed
database to speed searches for patterns. If a pattern is matched then
qmail delivers the email to the directory defined in the file using
the uid and gid which as also defined. Vpopmail makes use of this
method to have qmail deliver all virtual domain email as the single
uid/gid vpopmail/vchkpw. It also uses it to direct delivery to a
vpopmail/domains/&lt;virtualdomain&gt; directory.</P>
<P>Once qmail-local gets the information from the users/assign file
it performs standard .qmail file processing in the directory. Normal
.qmail-&lt;user&gt; files can be used for forwarding, aliases or
invoking programs such as ezmlm. If no matches are found qmail-local
looks for a .qmail-default file. This is the last stage in
qmail-locals delivery mechansim. Vpopmail uses this file to invoke
the vdelivermail program. This program takes two parameters, the
first is not used (it is there for backward compatibility). The
second parameter is the default delivery if a virtual domain user can
not be found. Basicly, it can be a directory to deliver the email to,
an email address to forward the email to, the string
&quot;bounce-no-mailbox&quot; to bounce the mail back to the sender
or the string &quot;delete&quot; to drop/delete the mail.</P>
<P>Once vdelivermail is started up, it uses the core vpopmail api
calls to check for a virtual domain user. If the user exists, the
email is delivered into their directory. If vpopmail was configured
for hard quotas (default is yes with 50Meg quota), then the size of
the users current email files in their Maildir/new and Maildir/cur
directories are counted. If the user is over quota the email is
bounced back to the user with a bounce message that can be
customized. If the message is 1Kbytes or smaller the email will
always be delivered. This is so system administration programs can
always get a message through to the user. 
</P>
<H3>Converting current user accounts</H3>
<P>The vconvert program can convert email accounts from one format
into another format. Conversion can be between /etc/passwd, vpasswd
files, mysql (small version) and mysql (large version. 
</P>
<P>Most current vpopmail users would probably be interested in how to
convert current domains into mysql domains. To make it simple to
convert an entire machine to mysql, use the following command:
vconvert -c -s  This will go through all the domains in
~vpopmail/domains directory and read each vpasswd file and load the
contents into the vpopmail.vpopmail mysql table. The vpasswd file is
left untouched for safety. Vconvert can also be run against one or
more domains at a time. This is done by running the command as so:
vconvert \c \s domain1 domain2 ...</P>
<P>To convert all users (except root and system accounts) into a
mysql domain run the following command: vconvert -e -s domain. This
reads all /etc/passwd accounts and creates mysql entries using their
passwords. The passwords can be in either /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow.
These passwords should work under vchkpw authentication program. 
</P>
<H3>Security and pop server under tcpserver</H3>
<P>If all of your pop email accounts are under virtual domains, you
can increase the security of your pop server by running it under the
uid and gid of vpopmail/vchkpw using the tcpserver -u and -g options.</P>

<H4>Overall vpopmail directory structure</H4>
<P>Vpopmail gets it's own home directory. Under this directory there
are the following:</P>
<DL>
	<DD>bin - contains all the binaries</DD><DD>
	lib - contains the libvpopmail.a file</DD><DD>
	include - contains the C header files</DD><DD>
	users - for backward compatibility for people who mix /etc/passwd
	users with vpopmail users in one domain</DD><DD>
	domains - where all the virtual domains are kept.</DD></DL>
<H4>
Virtual domain user directory structure</H4>
<P>Vpopmail uses an adaptive directory structure based on a state
file &quot;.dir-control&quot; which is automatically managed by the
core vpopmail api functions &quot;vadduser&quot; and &quot;vdeluser&quot;.
For sites with 100 users or less, all user directories are stored in
the virtual domain directory. For sites that go above 100 users the
adaptive directory structure goes into effect. The basic idea is to
break up the user Maildir directories across multple directories and
sub directories so that there are never more than 100 user
directories in a single directory.</P>
<P>The default directory setup allows for 62 directories in 3 levels
and 100 user directories per directory. The total number of user
directories is equal to 100 + (62 * 100) + (62 * 62 * 100) + (62 * 62
* 62 * 100) = over 24 million directories. This should be more than
sufficent for any site and probably goes beyond the technology of
directory structures. 
</P>
<P>If you are going to be storing large numbers of user directories,
make sure you set your file system to have a higher than normal
percentage of inodes. 
</P>
<P>Vpopmail will automatically create these directories and sub
directories as needed and populate each directory with up to 100 user
accounts. As soon as a directory reaches 100 users it will create the
next directory or sub directory and store the new users directory
there. 
</P>
<P>Look in the source code release directory contrib/ for a
contributed directory reorganization program.
</P>
<H3>Internationalization</H3>
<P>There is two messages that get inserted into emails. These are
both for bounced messages. The first is for no such user and the
second is for user over quota. Site administrators can customize
these messages by creating a .over-quota.msg and .no-user.msg file in
a virtual domain directory or in the main virtual domain directory.
If a .over-quota.msg file or .no-user.msg file are not found in the
virtual domain directory, then they are checked for in the main
virtual domain directory. If they are not found there, then the
default compiled message is included in the bounce message.</P>
<H3>dot-qmail processing</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every virtualdomain get's it's own
directory under ~vpopmail/domains. Qmail's user/assign file gets an
entry for each domain that</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">points qmail-local deliveries into this
directory. Therefore, all normal .qmail file processing works in each
virtual domain. .qmail files just need the user name extension to
work, i.e. .qmail-joe for user joe. Ezmlm uses .qmail files for
processing, so it will work under vpopmail.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P>If no user matches a .qmail file then the .qmail-default file is
processed. This file contains the vdelivermail program. This program
reads the authentication database (mysql or vpasswd.cdb) and
deliveres the mail into the users directory. The last parameter of
vdelivermail can be a maildir owned by vpopmail/vchkpw so that all
default mail reception ends up there. Or it can have an email
address, and all default mail is forwarded to this address. Last but
not least, the last parameter to vdelivermail can be the text
<FONT FACE="courier, monospace">bounce-no-mailbox.</FONT><FONT FACE="times, serif">
This will bounce all non matching emails back to the sender.</FONT></P>
<H3>qmailadmin</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qmailadmin provides a web based
interface for managing vpopmail domains. As of version 0.26, it uses
the vpopmail api. Which means it can manage mysql or vpasswd.cdb
authentication. It allows for adding pop users, managing
forwards/aliases, ezmlm mailing lists and autoresponders.</P>
<H3>sqwebmail</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sqwebmail is a web based email client.
It reads and writes directly to the users Maildirs. It can talk to
vpopmail vpasswd files. We have a modified version of 0.24 on
<A HREF="http://www.inter7.com/vpopmail">http://www.inter7.com/vpopmail</A>
which uses vpopmail api. It also supports setting the users password
and lets the user forward their mail. Hopefully these changes will be
intergrated into the standard distribution :)</P>
<H3>courier-imap</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Courier-imap is a IMAP server that
supports Maildirs. It's current release supports vpopmail vpasswd
files. We will be integrating the vpopmail api into the main
distribution soon.</P>
