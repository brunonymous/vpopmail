Intro
---------------------------------------------------------------

vpopmail is a collection of programs to automate creation and
maintence of non /etc/passwd virutal domain email and pop accounts 
for qmail installations.

Two additional packages support the vpopmail package:

qmailadmin provides a simple web based administration interface 
for pop account maintence, forwards, aliases, mailing lists 
and autoresponders.  http://sourceforge.net/projects/qmailadmin/

Sqwebmail provides a hot mail type web email system which
reads directly from the disks Maildirs, local, NFS or NAS.
and autoresponders.  http://www.inter7.com/sqwebmail/

Features for vpopmail
---------------------------------------------------------------

- uses one uid/gid for all email accounts

  two types of email addresses
  1) for domains in /var/qmail/control/locals the email
     addresses are:  user@any-domain-in-locals-file
     pop authentication user name is: user

     admin programs are: vadduser, vdeluser, vpasswd

        vadduser username optional-command-line-password -a (optional apop)
        vdeluser username 
        vpasswd  username optional-command-line-password -a (optional apop)

  2) for "virtual" domains in /var/qmail/control/virtualdomains
     addresses are of the form user@virtualdomain
     pop authentication user name is: 
	 user%virtualdomain or user@virtualdomain depending on email client

     admin programs are: vadddomain, vdeldomain, vpasswd

        vadddomain virtualdomain optional-command-line-password-for-postmaster 
                   -a (optional apop)
        vdeldomain virtualdomain 
        vadduser username@virtualdomain optional-command-line-password 
            -a (optional apop)
        vdeluser username@virtualdomain optional-command-line-password
            -a (optional apop)
        vpasswd  username@domainname optional-command-line-password 

 NOTE: for all of the above commands that take passwords: If the
       password is not specified,it will prompt the command line
       for it untill two successive entries match.

- automated and complete command line program to add a new 
  virtual domain: 

    admin program: vadddomain virtualdomain optional-postmaster-password 
        -a (for apop)

    This program does the following: 
        updates /var/qmail/control/rcpthosts
        updates /var/qmail/control/virtualdomains
        updates /var/qmail/users/assign
        updates /var/qmail/users/cdb
        runs /var/qmail/bin/qmail-newu

        sends hup signal to qmail-send to accept new domain

- disk limit hard quota for all users under the single uid/gid
  default is 50Meg per user

- automates opening up smtp relay for roaming users
  works in conjunction with the qmail-smtpd server run under
  tcpserver with the optional -x /etc/relayip.cdb feature

- email delivery is complete and allow for .qmail processing
  per domain and folder spliting per domain/user

  fully supports forwards, aliases, mailing lists, autoresponders
  or any other program which uses the dot-qmail syntax

- handles all email that does not match a pop user or .qmail in these ways:
    a) delivers to a pop account
    b) forwards to another email address
    c) bounces
    customizable in .qmail-default file per domain

- efficent and written in c

- supports /etc/passwd users as well as single uid/gid users

- requires qmail and tcpserver to fully operate all features

- can be used in scripts or programs to automate virtual domains and
  users account management

- tested on redhat 6.0, 5.2 (no shadow, default), solaris 5.7
  should work on other systems too. possible porting issue
  with format of ps command arguments

- simplified installation.
  uses configure ; make ; make install 
  configuration parameters allow for customizing to a sites disk layout
  auto detechs shadow or non shadow authentication per platform

  FAQ
---------------------------------------------------------------

0. How can I set one virtual domain to be the primary domain for
   the machine? We don't want to have any /etc/passwd users.

   configure vpopmail with this option:
       --enable-default-domain=<domain name>

   If you have already configured vpopmail you will need to do it
   again. make distclean ; ./configure < with your options > ; make 
   make install-strip;

   Then you can create the default domain with vadddomain <domain name>

   This will allow users of the primary domain to set thier
   pop user name to <user> instead of <user>%<virtualdomain>
 
1. How do I pop in to pick up my virtual domain email?

   Virtual domain users need to use the following format for thier
   user name when popping in:

        user%virtual_domain_name

   Eudora might require the following syntax
        user%virtual_domain_name@pophost

   Microsoft clients may the following syntax:
        user@virtual_domain   

   If you don't include the %virtual_domain_name, vpopmail will 
   assume it is either a /etc/passwd user or a vpop user in 
   ~vpopmail/users or configured with "default domain".

2. How do I forward all mail that doesn't match any pop users or .qmail
   files for a particular domain?

   Edit the ~vpopmail/domains/virtual_domain/.qmail-default file and 
   change the last parameter to an email address of the form: user@domain

3. How do I bounce all mail that doesn't match any pop users or .qmail
   files for a particular domain?

   Edit the ~vpopmail/domains/virtual_domain/.qmail-default file and 
   change the last parameter to "bounce-no-mailbox" without the quotes.

   For example:
   # more .qmail-default
   | /home/vpopmail/bin/vdelivermail '' bounce-no-mailbox 


4. How do I allow roaming users to use our smtp server without opening
   the machine up to everyone on the internet? 

   Your startup script for the qmail smtp server must use the 
   tcpserver -x file command similar to this startup line. 

    env - PATH="/var/qmail/bin:/usr/local/bin" \
    tcpserver -H -R -x /path/to/vpopmail/etc/tcp.smtp.cdb \
	-c20 -u504 -g503 0 smtp \
    /var/qmail/bin/qmail-smtpd 2>&1 > /dev/null &

Here are our qmail /etc/passwd entries
alias:x:503:503::/var/qmail/alias:/bin/bash
qmaild:x:504:503::/var/qmail:/bin/bash
qmaill:x:505:503::/var/qmail:/bin/bash
qmailp:x:506:503::/var/qmail:/bin/bash
qmailq:x:507:504::/var/qmail:/bin/bash
qmailr:x:508:504::/var/qmail:/bin/bash
qmails:x:509:504::/var/qmail:/bin/bash

    modify the -u503 and -g503 to match your systems 
    qmaild user id and group id

   Configure vpopmail with an additional option --enable-roaming-users=y

   Then edit the /path/to/vpopmail/etc/tcp.smtp file and put in lines for all
   static IP's that you will always want to allow relay access to.
   For example:

    127.0.0.:allow,RELAYCLIENT=""
    10.1.1.:allow,RELAYCLIENT=""

   The above lines will allow the localhost and all machines on the 10.1.1 C
   class to relay thru.

   You should always put in the 127.0.0 and the IP of the machine 
   vpopmail is running on and any aliased IPs.

   Then run the following command
   /path/to/vpopmail/bin/clearopensmtp

   Then, every time someone pops in and authenticates, the follow happens:

        1) vpopmail asks for an exclusive lock on the 
		   ~vpopmail/etc/open-smtp.lock file
        2) it will wait for the lock, once it gets it, it will continue
        3) it adds the pop users IP into ~vpopmail/etc/open-smtp file with a 
           time stamp. If the IP already exsists, it updates the timestamp.
        4) it runs tcprules to regenerate the /etc/tcp.smtp.cdb file
        5) releases lock and new IP becomes available to the next 
           smtp invocation.

    At this point, the smtp server configured above will allow that
    IP to relay for 1 hour (default).

    You should setup cron to run the following:
        40 * * * * /home/vpopmail/bin/clearopensmtp 
    Change /home/vpopmail to be your vpopmails home dir.

    clearopenstmp will ask for a lock, clear out any roaming IP's 
    whos timestamps are over 1 hour old since last pop authentication.
    merges the two files vpopmail does above and run tcprules. 
    Thus closing off relay for those aged IPs.


    I think it's pretty cool :)

5. What is a sample start script for the pop server?

    env - PATH="/var/qmail/bin:/usr/local/bin" \
    tcpserver 0 pop-3 /var/qmail/bin/qmail-popup orbital.inter7.com \
    /home/vpopmail/bin/vchkpw /var/qmail/bin/qmail-pop3d Maildir &

6. How do hard quota's for users work?

    When mail is delivered to a virtual domain, vdelivermail
    will deliver it to the pop users directory. vdelivermail
    will enter the users Maildir and add up the sizes of all 
    the files in these directories. If the size is greater
    than the HARD_QUOTA limit. The email is bounced back to
    the sender.

    Use the default_quota and default_maxmsgcount options in
    ~vpopmail/etc/vlimits.default or the .qmailadmin-limits
    file for the domain to change the default quota for new
    users.  The program vmoduser can be used to update quotas
    for existing accounts.  Please read README.quotas for more
    information on maildirquotas and syntax information.

7. I installed qmail in a place other than /var/qmail. How should
   I configure vpopmail for it?

   ./configure --enable-qmaildir=qmail-install-path

8. I want to use a different file name than /etc/tcp.smtp for my
   static IPs for perment relay.

   ./configure --enable-tcpserver-file=smtp-relay-file

9. How can we use an IP address per domain, so that users don't need
   to authenticate with user%domain or user@domain, 
   they just want to use "user"?

   ./configure --enable-ip-alias-domains=y

   Then run vipmap -a IP domain for each IP you want to link to a domain.

10. Why was the name of the package changed from vchkpw to vpopmail?

    Because no one could pronounce vchkpw and vpopmail is more descriptive.
    V for virtual, pop for pop server, mail for mail!

11. Logging? Please tell me about logging

    ./configure --enable-logging= 
        y means log all successful and unsucessful attemps and fatal errors
        n means don't log anything
        e means only log errors and fatal errors
        p means include passwords in errors
        v means log everything, including passwords in errors


    By default we set it up to only log errors and fatal errors.

12. How do I alias a new virtual domain to a current virtualdomain?

    vaddaliasdomain new_domain old_domain

13. How do I post a email to all users of a virtualdomain or a set
    of domains?

    use the new vpopbull program:

    vpopbull -f email_file vdomain vdomain ...

    To see all the available options run vpopmail with no options.
    It will print out a complete list.

14. Is there a mailing list available for vpopmail users?

    Yes. Send a message to vchkpw-subscribe@inter7.com

15. How do I setup vpopmail to talk to mysql?
    Read the README.mysql file.

16. I want to upgrade vpopmail, what do I need to worry about?
    Two things happen on an upgrade. The programs, library and
	include files get over written and the permissions get fixed. 
	None of the users or domain get touched. So to upgrade:
    1) download new vpopmail software
    2) ./configure with your options
    3) make
    4) make install-strip
    5) upgrade completed.

    If you want to backup the programs, libraries and include files
	then back up ~vpopmail/bin, ~vpopmail/include and ~vpopmail/lib

17. Will IMAP work with vpopmail?

Yes. Here's a quick way to get up and running with Courier-IMAP
   using both authpam (/etc/passwd) and vchkpw for auth:

a) Download the Courier-IMAP available at Inter 7's Courier-IMAP
    site.

b) Configure it (as a NON-root user) with the following option:
    --enable-workarounds-for-imap-client-bugs

c) Run make as a NON-root user.

d) Run make check as a NON-root user. It will fail when it tries 
    to check mail. This is normal because of the --enable-workarounds...
    option.
    
e) Run make install-strip as root.

f) You can follow the INSTALL's instructions on the startup file, but
    I just added a sym link to the imapd.rc file into /etc/rc.d/init.d:
    
    cd /etc/rc.d/init.d
    ln -s /usr/lib/courier-imap/libexec/imapd.rc imapd.rc
    
    Then just create your necessary S and K links. Here's mine:
    
    cd /etc/rc.d/rc3.d
    ln -s ../init.d/imapd.rc S70imapd.rc (S70 is also that of qmail).
    cd ../rc2.d
    ln -s ../init.d/imapd.rc K70imapd.rc
    
g) If you are only using IMAP for vpopmail accounts (read: NON-shell 
    accounts) then you are all setup. It should have added the proper
    AUTHMODULES to your config file (/usr/lib/courier-imap/etc/imapd.config)
    
    AUTHMODULES="authcram authuserdb authvchkpw authpam"
    
    If you do plan to have it work for shell users AND vpopmail users, you
    need to re-order the AUTHMODULES so that it auths via "authpam" first:
    
    AUTHMODULES="authpam authcram authuserdb authvchkpw"
    
h) That's it. Reboot or run /etc/init.d/imapd.rc start to start it up. I
    reboot just to make sure things are fine after a reboot.

NOTE: when you setup your IMAP client to login to your virtual domain, DO NOT
use user%domain.com as with POP clients. Use user@domain.com. The % seems to
cause problems and I could not get Eudora or IMP (see below) to auth with that
format. When you check mail for a shell user, just put in the username for
the login ID, NOT the username@domain.com, but just username.


18. Can I use vpopmail with IMP (www.horde.org/imp)?

Yes. The newer version of IMP support POP so all you would need to 
do is set that up and make the necessary mods for POP logins, but
with IMAP you can have your users create folders and such, which is more
flexible if they plan to use IMP for the majority of their mail needs. This
will describe how to setup IMP to work with vpopmail + Courier-IMAP. I
only describe what you need to make IMP work, you'll need to follow the
Horde/IMP instructions for the rest.

a) Install qmail + vpopmail.

b) Install Courier-IMAP as per the previous FAQ.

c) Test this installation and make sure you can use Netscape/Outlook/Eudora
    or some other IMAP client to log in. Also, you can use IMPs test client at
    https://ssl.horde.org to log into your virtual host (make sure you can
    create and delete folders). If this works, you are all set for your own IMP    setup.
    
d) Install Apache + PHP (I used PHP3). You WILL run into the problem
    where PHP is looking for mail.h and a slew of other libraries not
    included with Courier-IMAP. Download, compile and install UW IMAP
    (installing it won't cause problems) and point the PHP --enable-imap
    to the appropriate install directories. If you chose all the defaults for
    UW IMAP just use --enable-imap.

e) Download the Horde and IMP components. IMP is somewhat complicated to 
    install so go slow and follow the instructions on their Web site.

f) After your install, edit <IMP DIR>/config/defaults.php3 (or .php) and 
    change the following:

    $default->folders                        = '';

    to:

    $default->folders                        = 'INBOX.';

    This will allow IMP to create folders with Courier-IMAP.
    
g) Finish configuring IMP and test it out.

19. what is --enable-many-domains option do?

The default is for --enable-many-domains=y. This is for
sites that will have more than 10 domains on thier system.

If you have a large number of users ( more than 10,000 ) 
AND you will only be hosting 10 domains or less AND you
are using mysql/oracle modules THEN use "no"
--enable-many-domains=n

Do NOT turn off many-domains unless you *know* exactly
what that does.


--- Pre vpopmail-5.0 answer ------
What is the difference between the --enable-large-site=y or n
This option only has effect for mysql (--enable-mysql=y).

It has to do with database optimization. Consider two different
sites. A) One site has only one domain (or maybe a few) with 
many many users. B) The other site has LOTS of domains with
some users in each domain.  These two different extremes
place different design considerations on a database schema.

Two things to optimize: 1) space 2) access speeds.

For site A) We can create a table for each of the domains
and name each table by the domain name. This is similar
to the vpasswd.cdb module. Each domain has it's own
authentication file. Works great. This is the
--enable-large-site=y option (the default is n)

For site B) If we did the same thing as for site A we
would end up with many many tables in mysql. The problem
is, mysql doesn't do well with many tables that get
opened and closed alot. Hence, we came up with an 
optimization. We use only one table and include a
column for the domain name. This is the default setup.

If you use large site = yes and have more than 10 domains
take a look at section 12.2.4 How MySQL Opens and Closes Tables 
in the MySQL manual.  This can be set to a large number - but 
you may run into OS limits.


20. How do I control the database and table names in mysql?

--enable-large-site=y 
This option is for sql only. Each domain has it's own 
table in the vpopmail database. For large sites with
only a few domains, this is the optimial database
layout. For sites with a large number of domains,
this is a bad option.

--enable-large-site=n (default)
For sql storage, it creates on table named vpopmail
in the vpopmail database.

To change these names edit vmysql.h

#define MYSQL_DATABASE "vpopmail"
This entry defines which database to use

#define MYSQL_DEFAULT_TABLE "vpopmail"
This entry defines which table to use --enable-large-site=n (default)

21. Why can't pop authenticate on my slackware distribution.

Some distributions of slackware (current distro as of July/2000)
do not come with a functional crypt routine. To fix the problem
you must install the real crypt libraries and recompile.

22. How do I forward all email to a different site?

Edit the .qmail-default file and put in:

| /home/vpopmail/bin/vdelivermail '' $EXT@newdomain.com

This will forward all non matching emails to user@newdomain.com

23. How come, about every hour or so, everything stops working?

If you are using qmail from an rpm, there are some rpms that
install an hourly cron job that rebuilds the /var/qmail/users/assign
file from /etc/passwd. Unfortunately that cron job destroys all
of the vpopmail information. 

Solution: 1) remove the cron job
          2) delete and re-add your virtual domains, or rebuild
             the assign file from scratch.

24. We are using NFS and sometimes things break! 

   Alot of the file update routines use locks to synchronize
   multiple updates to the same file. If you are using NFS this
   requires NFS locking to work, which it doesn't always do.

   Here is some real world feedback:
   After upgrading all of the servers to work with
   the kernel NFS facility, the file locking issue went away.
   I think this is because the newer knfsd has a lockd and
   statd to work with those kinds of things.  I have not had
   one lock failure yet, and the server is averaging over 110
   Million NFS calls daily!
   In the future, you might suggest to people with busy NFS
   servers who have locking issues to upgrade to use
   kernel-level NFS. ;)
   Brad Baker
   Director: Network Operations
   Americanisp

   So you might consider using kernel level NFS!

25. How to use ssh tunnels with pop?

    Here is a url for the answer:
	http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/fetchmail/fetchmail-FAQ.html#K3

26. vaddomain fails on my Debian qmail installation

    ln -s /usr/sbin /var/qmail/bin

	vpopmail assumes qmail's bin, control and user directories
	are under qmails base directory (default is /var/qmail )

	The debian distribution puts qmails binaries under /usr/sbin.
	Creating a symlink above will solve the problem.

27. How do I log when people authenticate with pop? 

    Currently this only works with mysql. Make sure you include
	these two configuration options.

	./configure --enable-mysql=y --enable-auth-logging=y

28. How do I compile sqwebmail with vpopmail and mysql?

    At the begining of your sqwebmail configure add this:
    env "LIBS=-L/usr/lib/mysql -lmysqlclient -lz" \
    ./configure ......

    This tells the sqwebmail Makefile to include the mysql libraries and
    path to the libraries. Modify the above path if you have installed
    mysql libraries in a different location.

29. How can I uninstall vpopmail?

    On Gnu/Linux type systems as root:
    # userdel -r vpopmail
    # groupdel vchkpw
    Done

    To completly clean your qmail installation of virtual domains
    # rm -rf /var/qmail/control/virt* 
    # rm -rf /var/qmail/control/rcpt*
    # rm -rf /var/qmail/control/more*
    # cp /var/qmail/control/locals /var/qmail/control/rcpthosts
    # rm -rf /var/qmail/users/*

    If enable roaming users and your tcp.smtp file was not in
    the vpopmail/etc directory, you will need to remove the
    open-smtp* files, where ever they are.

30. I get errors about not finding a .so library, how to fix?
    Your operating system does not know where those shared 
    object libraries are. On linux read up on how to use ld.so.conf
    Edit /etc/ld.so.con and run ldconfig.

    Another method is to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
 
    For example:

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/libmysqlclient.so.6

31. What is the relationship between ~vpopmail/etc/open-smtp
    ~vpopmail/etc/tcp.smtp and ~vpopmail/etc/tcp.smtp.cdb and how do they 
    work with the smtpserver? (by Bram Dumolin <bram@grmbl.be> )

   If you are running qmail-smtpd under tcpserver, you should add a -x
   ~vpopmail/etc/tcp.smtp.cdb option to it.
   This makes sure that qmail-smtpd checks in that file for allowed relaying (on
   top of the onces in /var/qmail/control/rcpthosts).

   This ~vpopmail/etc/tcp.smtpd.cdb needs to be created manually first :
        /path/to/tcprules ~vpopmail/etc/tcp.smtpd.cdb blah <
   ~vpopmail/etc/tcp.smtp
   This will enable the roaming for all hosts/networks you put in
   ~vpopmail/etc/tcp.smtp which is necessary if you want to use your mailserver
   from the local network.

   Secondly, check the permissions of the files in ~vpopmail/etc/
   They should be owned by the user running the tcpserver with the popserver 
   as that user needs to update those files.

   Everytime a user logs into the popserver, his ip and a timestamp gets 
   written to ~vpopmail/etc/open-smtp
   If he's allowed in, the tcp.smtp.cdb gets regenerated automatically from the
   open-smtp file and the tcp.smtp file.

32. I don't want to bounce emails for non existent users. Instead I want
    to delete them, how?

   The last parameter in the .qmail-default file tells vdelivermail
   what to do with non-matching emails. The default is to bounce
   the email back to the sender. But you can also delete it instead.

   update your .qmail-default file  from something like this:
   | /home/vpopmail/bin/vdelivermail '' bounce-no-mailbox 

   to something like this:
   | /home/vpopmail/bin/vdelivermail '' delete 

33. Quota usage doesn't decrease after deleting messages with qmail-pop3d!

    Vpopmail 5.1.1 and above now use maildirquotas.  qmail-pop3d doesn't 
    support maildirquotas.  Patch qmail with 
    contrib/qmail-maildir++.patch to add maildirquota support to
    qmail-pop3d and qmail-local.  See README.quotas for other options and more 
    information on maildirquotas in vpopmail.

34. How do I get Courier-IMAP use vpopmail's "roaming users"?

    1. Make sure vpopmail is compiled with --enable-roaming-users=y
    2. Courier-IMAP doesn't  detect roaming users in the vpopmail library 
       correctly, so force it by doing something like this just before 
       compiling:
         export CFLAGS="-DHAVE_OPEN_SMTP_RELAY"
    3. compile courier-imap with --without-authdaemon --with-authvchkpw
    4. Make sure you run your imap server as the same user as your pop 
       server (so open-smtp and tcp.smtp have the same ownership).  man 
       couriertcpd for details, but you will change /usr/lib/courier-
       imap/libexec/imapd.rc something like this:
    
    Change this line:
    /usr/lib/courier-imap/libexec/couriertcpd -address=$ADDRESS \
    
    To:
    /usr/lib/courier-imap/libexec/couriertcpd -address=$ADDRESS \
	    -user=vpopmail -group=vchkpw \

    NOTE: some people report problems using the -user -group options
          for the above lines

35. How to run vadddomain as non root
1) make sure /var/qmail/control directory and all the files inside
   it are owned by your non root user (vpopmail).
2) make sure /var/qmail/users directory and all the files inside
   are owned by your non root user (vpopmail)
3) change permissions on /var/qmail/bin/qmail-newu to allow non
   root users to run it. chmod ugo+rx /var/qmail/bin/qmail-newu
4) after adding the domain have root signal qmail-send with HUP
   to tell it to re-read it's control files.
5) change permissions on /var/qmail/bin/qmail-newmrh to allow
   non root users to run it. chmod ugo+rx /var/qmail/bin/qmail-newmrh

36. I want to have vpopmail access mysql as vpopmail and not root. What 
    sql commands to I run? 

First log into mysql as your mysql root user and pass. Then:
> create database vpopmail;
> use mysql;
> grant select, insert, update, delete, create, drop on vpopmail.* to 
  vpopmail@localhost identified by 'your password';

That will create the vpopmail database then create a vpopmail login
with access to the vpopmail database and will set the password to
'your password'. Pick something random to put in for 'your password'.

Edit the vmysql.h file and change "root" to "vpopmail" and change
"secret" to whatever you picked as 'your password'.


37. This all sounds great, but we are running a busines.  Is there 
   commerical installation/support/maintenece available?
        For $225 Inter7 will install qmail, tcpserver, boot scripts and
        vpopmail on your machine and test via the internet to anywhere.
        Call (847) 492-0470 for details.  24/7 support is available. 

        This is an example of GPL freeware in the market place. We can
        lower your cost for setting up qmail and at the same time increase
        your email functionality and efficeny by using qmail. We also
        provide administration training.

        Many other commerical (like exchange on NT) email packages cost 
        more than the installation fee. Runs wonderfully on Unixen and Linux.
        Plus you can do it yourself.
