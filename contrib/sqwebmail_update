> Then i've updated the sqwebmail authlib/preauthvchkpw.c code to use

>         vget_assign(s,NULL,0,&uid, &gid);
>         pw=vauth_getpw(usercopy, s);
>         if ( pw!=NULL ) {
>                 if (pw->pw_dir == NULL || strlen(pw->pw_dir) == 0 ) {
>                         make_user_dir(usercopy, s, uid, gid);
>                         pw=vauth_getpw(usercopy, s);
>                 }
>                 vlogauth(pw, s, service);
>         }
>         free(usercopy);
>         vclose();
>
> You'll notice it does the check for a null or zero length directory
> and calls make_user_dir to make it.
>
> It also calls the new vlogauth function to updated the lastlog table
> so you'll know if they authenticated with sqwebmail. By default this
> code is disabled. if you want it to log that you'll need to add
> --enable-auth-log=y
